# Digital-Signal-Processing-Voice-Denoising-and-Augmentation-with-Preset-Effects
In this project, we develop a system that mainly involves two stages for processing noisy voice input. The first stage recovers the original signal buried in the noise from the noisy input, and the second stage adds some effects in combination with echo and delays to make the voice funny. We implemented the first step using Simulink and the later stage directly on an FRDM-K64 board. In the future, we plan to link these steps and implement them entirely on the FRDM-K64 board to develop a stand-alone voice processing system.
